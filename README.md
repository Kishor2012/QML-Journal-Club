## Welcome to the Quantum Machine learning Journal club @CQT

### Aim of the journal club
Machine learning seems to be a hot topic. And here at CQT, we have a lot of experts in quantum information processing. Here we are interested in the relation of the two: How machine learning could be useful for quantum information processing? How quantum computer/quantum algorithms could enhance machine learning? 

### Scope
- Quantum algorithms, especially those involved in machine learning
- Classical machine learning
- Experimental considerations? 

### Format
- (Bi-)Weekly paper presentation by the participants, they can either choose from the list or propose their own
- Tutorials by experts
- Coding exercises? Maybe
